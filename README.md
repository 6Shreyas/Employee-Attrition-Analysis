# Employee Attrition Analysis

Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major concern for organizations as it leads to increased
recruitment costs and loss of experienced talent. This project focuses on
understanding the factors influencing employee turnover and predicting which
employees are likely to leave the organization using machine learning.

Objective
- Understand employee turnover patterns
- Identify key factors contributing to attrition
- Predict employee attrition using classification models

Dataset
- IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset (Kaggle)
- Records: 1,470 employees
- Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
- Attrition distribution among employees
- Monthly income vs attrition
- Job role and department impact on attrition

Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Recall
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision–Recall Curve

Key Insights
- Employees with lower monthly income show higher attrition
- Certain job roles have higher turnover rates
- Work experience and job level significantly impact attrition

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

Conclusion
The project successfully analyzes employee turnover and predicts attrition using
machine learning models. The insights can help HR departments take proactive
retention measures and reduce employee turnover.
